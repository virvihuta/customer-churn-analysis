# Customer Churn Prediction

An **end-to-end data science and machine learning project** focused on predicting **customer churn** — identifying which customers are likely to stop using a service.  
This project covers everything a professional data scientist would do with a new dataset: from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to statistical inference, classical ML, and deep learning.

## Overview

**Goal:**  
Understand customer behavior and predict churn probability using statistical analysis, feature engineering and machine learning.

**Dataset:**  
Telco Customer Churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

**Core Idea:**  
Customer churn (attrition) occurs when users stop doing business with a company.  
Predicting churn helps businesses identify at-risk customers early and take preventive action (offers, support, retention campaigns).

## Project Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Data Audit & Cleaning** | Inspect schema, handle missing values, fix types, remove duplicates, and ensure data quality. |
| **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Analyze distributions, correlations, churn rates, and visualize insights with Matplotlib/Seaborn. |
| **3. Descriptive & Inferential Statistics** | Compute summary metrics, test hypotheses (t-test, chi-square), and study group differences. |
| **4. Feature Engineering** | Encode categorical features, normalize numeric ones, create interaction terms, and design behavioral features. |
| **5. Machine Learning Models** | Build Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers using Scikit-learn. |
| **6. Deep Learning Model** | Implement a PyTorch neural network for churn prediction with embeddings for categorical variables. |
| **7. Evaluation & Interpretation** | Evaluate with ROC-AUC, F1, Precision-Recall, Confusion Matrix, and interpret SHAP feature importance. |
| **8. Insights & Reporting** | Highlight the most important churn factors and propose retention strategies. |
